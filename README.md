# DMX Traffic light

This repository contains the code for an Arduino UNO used as a DMX slave to control a traffic light found in the streets.

The 8 pin switch on top of the box control allow to select the DMX adress, if the address is set to 0, the box will work in strobo mode. In this mode the potentiometer on the side of the box control the frequency of the stroboscope.
